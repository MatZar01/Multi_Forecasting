# Multi Forecasting
Neuroplasticity-inspired method for multi-tasking in demand forecasting scenarios on vast datasets.

## Initial info

This is a code repository for the paper **Dynamic ANNs for multi-task demand forecasting**. 

We tested our methods on datasets:

- [Demand-Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aswathrao/demand-forecasting)
- [Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/demand-forecasting-kernels-only)
- [Product Demand Forecast](https://www.kaggle.com/code/flavioakplaka/product-demand-forecast)

and are happy with the results. Below, you'll find information on how to use our methods out-of-the-box with **Demand-Forecasting** as well as how to set up your own experiments on the data you would like to try.
